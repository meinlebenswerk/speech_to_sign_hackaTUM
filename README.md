# Baby Signs
A Speech to sign-language translator built with Google Speech-API and PyQT.

## Prerequisites
A dictionary of videos for text to sign conversion, place into data/video. As far as pip-packages go: google-speech pyaudio pyqt5 and pyqt5-multimedia.
(On linux this had to be installed via the package manager -> sometimes this is finicky as far as drivers are concerned)

## How to run:
just run the loadGUI file -> you have to have a valid google API-key in the corresponding System-variable.
